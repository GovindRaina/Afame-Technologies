HR Data Cleansing Project

This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing an HR dataset to make it suitable for further analysis and modeling. The dataset contains various attributes related to employees, such as demographic information, job roles, and performance metrics.

Dataset

The dataset, HR Data.csv, includes information on:

Employee demographics (e.g., age, gender)
Job details (e.g., department, job role, job level)
Compensation (e.g., daily rate, monthly income)
Performance and satisfaction metrics (e.g., job satisfaction, performance rating)
Work-life balance indicators (e.g., work-life balance, overtime)
Data Cleansing Steps
The cleansing process involves the following steps:

Loading the Dataset: Importing the dataset for processing.
Trimming Whitespace: Removing leading and trailing whitespace from string columns to ensure consistency.
Converting Data Types: Changing specific columns to appropriate data types, such as converting columns to categorical types.
Handling NaN Values: Removing rows with any missing values to ensure a clean dataset.
Renaming Columns: Renaming columns for clarity and consistency.
Removing Unnecessary Columns: Dropping columns that are constant or deemed unnecessary to simplify the dataset.

#Usage
Clone the Repository: Download the project files from GitHub.
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (e.g., pandas).
Run the Script/Notebook: Execute the data cleansing steps as outlined to process the dataset.
